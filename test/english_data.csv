Hush, little Baby, don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a Mockingbird

And if that mockingbird don't sing
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

And if that diamond ring turns brass
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

And if that looking glass is broke
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat


And if that billy goat won't pull
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and a bull

And if that cart and bull turn over
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover

And if that dog named Rover won't bark
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and a cart

And if that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town

FAQ:

‚Äì  Can I use this music in my videos?

To use this music in your videos or media projects, you must first purchase a license from the link above. You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel as a YouTube partner.

‚Äì  What happens if I use this song on YouTube without buying a license?

Your video will be staged and monetization disabled. It is not allowed to use music from our collection without buying a license.

‚Äì  Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?

'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.
Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase.

Cry Baby Lyrics:

I know what you did last night
I called you up and you declined
I smell perfume but it ain‚Äôt mine
It‚Äôs not okay but it‚Äôs alright

Cause you telling so many lies I gotta let you go
Now you know what it‚Äôs like to be all alone
Tell me
How you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most
Cause your tears gon cry a river go let it flow

Don‚Äôt want no cry baby at my door I‚Äôll let him go
Boy I ain‚Äôt the same girl I was before
You‚Äôre only crying cause I don‚Äôt want you back no more
Boy you had your chance
And you can keep on crying baby

I know you been lyin‚Äô baby

So you can keep on crying baby

I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre waiting for
I packed your bags outside the door
No I don‚Äôt wanna sit and talk
Can you hurry up I‚Äôm bored

Cause you telling so many lies I gotta let you go
Now you know what it‚Äôs like to be all alone
Tell me
How you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most
Cause your tears gon cry a river go let it flow

Don‚Äôt want no cry baby at my door I‚Äôll let him go
Boy I ain‚Äôt the same girl I was before
You‚Äôre only crying cause I don‚Äôt want you back no more
Boy you had your chance
And you can keep on crying baby

Ohhhhh
I know you been lying baby
Ohhhhh
So you can keep on crying baby
You can keep on crying baby boy
I know you been, I know you been lying baby
So you can keep on crying baby

üé§ Lyrics: Clean Bandit, Anne-Marie, David Guetta - Cry Baby 

[Verse 1]
I know what you did last night
I called you up and you declined
I smell perfume, but it ain't mine
It's not okay, but it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go
Now you know what it's like to be all alone
Tell me, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most?
'Cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow

[Chorus]
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more
Boy, you had your chance
And you can keep on cryin', baby

[Post-Chorus]
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you're waiting for
I packed your bags outside the door, uh
No, I don't wanna sit and talk
Can you hurry up? I'm bored

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go, mm
Now you know what it's lik–µ to be all alone
Tell m–µ, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most? Yeah, 'cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow

[Chorus]
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before (No, I ain't the same)
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more (I don't want you back)
Boy, you had your chance (Ha-ha)
And you can keep on cryin', baby

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh)
I know you been lyin', baby
(Oh-oh, mm)
So you can keep on cryin', baby

[Outro]
You can keep on cryin', baby boy
I know you been
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby

There‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt do together

üé§ Lyrics: The Neighbourhood - Cry Baby

[Verse 1]
I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen good
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'
I spend too much time explainin' myself
I hope there's some time to change it

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
That you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Verse 2]
I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I've got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute when I'm with you, breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
That you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Bridge]
The Sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder
I can't wait 'til the drought is over

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
Yeah, that's just what I'll do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Outro]
Cry baby, cry baby
I need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
You need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
We need to cry
And if we do, I know that would be alright

Title: When The Children Cry
Artist: White Lion
Album: Pride
Year: 1987

Lyrics:

Little child dry your cryin' eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killin' man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

When the children cry let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
'Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
'Cause when the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

I‚Äôm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don‚Äôt cry?
Come on baby let‚Äôs take one last ride

We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel if you catch my drift
We‚Äôre riding around on this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel, getting dizzy til we‚Äôre sick
Love is like a circle, there‚Äôs no easy way to end

It‚Äôs too much, I can‚Äôt take anymore
Stuck feeling like we‚Äôve been here before
But now the sun stopped shining here in the wild west
My heart stopped beating and it sunk into my chest

We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel if you catch my drift
We‚Äôre riding around on this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel, getting dizzy til we‚Äôre sick
Love is like a circle, there‚Äôs no easy way to end

Just an outlaw, who only had one friend
I wonder if I‚Äôll ever see her face again
Dark clouds hanging over, they follow where I‚Äôve been
My cowboy tears are still blowing in the wind

We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel if you catch my drift
We‚Äôre riding around on this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel, getting dizzy til we‚Äôre sick
Love is like a circle, there‚Äôs no easy way to end

I‚Äôm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don‚Äôt cry?
Come on baby let‚Äôs take one last ride

We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel if you catch my drift
We‚Äôre riding around on this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
We‚Äôre riding around on this carousel, getting dizzy til we‚Äôre sick
Love is like a circle, there‚Äôs no easy way to end

Little child
Dry your crying eyes
How can I explain
The fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born

Where man is killing man
And no one knows just why

What have we become
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

Little child
You must show the way
To a better day
For all the young
'Cause you were born
For the world to see
That we all can live
With love and peace

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing

What have we become
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children fight
Let them know it ain't right
When the children pray
Let them know the way
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

That struggle is amplified by the fact that babies can't communicate their needs, often leaving parents attempting every solution to get them to settle. If you find yourself in a similar situation with your baby, we may have the perfect solution for you! Baby white noise can be a powerful tool every parent should have on their utility belt! The consistent sleep sound creates a calming atmosphere that can help ease your babies colic. Additionally, baby white noise can help cover up outside sounds that keep your baby up at night. Not to mention, this sleep white noise sounds just like what babies heard in the womb, bringing a sense of familiarity with all that comfort! Millions of parents rely on white noise to sleep when they put their precious one to sleep. Next time your child is struggling to feel relaxed, you should give it a try too! You may never have another bedtime without it! 

While playing white noise for babies, it‚Äôs important to keep tabs on the volume, because any white noise machine, smartphone, or computer can put out levels that are too loud for your child. It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower.

Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app.

We were decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious witch, what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We were decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious zombie - what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We're decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There're some bandage on the ground, is a mummy here?
Does the mummy keep my baby?
Oh oh no!
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We're decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious  , what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
Oh could you help me buddy to find my baby?
