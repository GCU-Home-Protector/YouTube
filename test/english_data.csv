Lyrics

the itsy bitsy spider 
climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain 
and wash the spider out
out came the sun and 
dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider 
climed up the spout again

the itsy bitsy spider 
climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain 
and wash the spider out
out came the sun 
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider 
climed up the spout again

the itsy bitsy spider 
climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain 
and wash the spider out
out came the sun 
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider 
climed up the spout again

the itsy bitsy spider 
climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain 
and wash the spider out
out came the sun 
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider 
climed up- the- spout--- again! Pororo Season 5 is now on YouTube!! Click here : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...

Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only four little ducks came back
Red, green, blue, yellow

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only two little ducks came back
Red, green

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But only one little duck came back
Red

One little duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
But none of the five little ducks came back

Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ""Quack, quack, quack, quack""
And all five little ducks came back

Five little ducks went out one day

üéµ Lyrics üéµ
Drums, guitar, violin, maracas
Piano, xylophone, flute and trumpet
Eight musical instruments that are very fun to play
So listen cause we‚Äôll learn them all today

The drums can be played with your hands or sticks
The guitar is very popular and the planets love it
The violin has a bow that is used to play
And maracas you can play them as you dance, hey!

Drums, guitar, violin, maracas
Piano, xylophone, flute and trumpet
Eight musical instruments that are very fun to play
So listen cause we‚Äôll learn them all today

The piano has many keys, some are white and some are black
The xylophone is made with small wooden planks
The flute has many holes, try and cover them all
And the trumpet‚Äôs sound is very powerful

Drums, guitar, violin, maracas
Piano, xylophone, flute and trumpet
Eight musical instruments that are very fun to play
So listen cause we‚Äôll learn them all today

Once more!

Drums, guitar, violin, maracas
Piano, xylophone, flute and trumpet
Eight musical instruments that are very fun to play
And now you know them, which one will you learn
To play?

Lyrics:
We were decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious witch, what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We were decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious zombie - what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We're decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There're some bandage on the ground, is a mummy here?
Does the mummy keep my baby?
Oh oh no!
I have to keep on searching - for my baby

We're decorating for Halloween
Then my baby is no where to be seen
Where have you gone my baby, so suddenly?
Who took my baby - away on Halloween?

It's a spooky Halloween
There's a suspicious  , what's she doing?
Could it be that she's keeping him?
No she's not! 
Oh could you help me buddy to find my baby?
